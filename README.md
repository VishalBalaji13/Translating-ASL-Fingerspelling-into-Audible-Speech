# Translating-ASL-Fingerspelling-into-Audible-Speech

SignLingua is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system designed to bridge the communication gap between deaf and hearing individuals using deep learning and computer vision. The platform uses a lightweight custom CNN to recognize ASL alphabet gestures from a standard webcam feed, translating them into text (and optionally speech) with low latency and high accuracy. Built as a full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI/WebSocket backend, the system emphasizes accessibility, affordability, and real-time performance without requiring specialized hardware. By combining efficient preprocessing, adaptive thresholding, and optimized model design, SignLingua demonstrates a practical AI-driven approach to inclusive communication.
